## Process


### Nuclear 1

This is a graph showing the amount of underground nuclear tests the United States executed each year in the defined time range. It is interesting to see how many there were and during what years there were more than others.

### Nuclear 2

This is a graph showing the amount of total tests each country conducted over the date range. This also includes the grand total.

### Nuclear 3

This chart shows the total amount of each type of test conducted by any country within the date range of the data. There is a grand total as well.

### Practice sketches

This sketch is an experimentation using circles as a represenation of frequency as well as magnitude of the explosion. I think this could look cool across a large dataset as long as the scale is manageable.

This sketch shows a similar approach to the previous sketch, but a more broad view of nuclear tests over time and from multiple nations. I am hoping to gather a sense of scale for this idea through the sketch. How many nations should I focus on? How many tests can I show?

As an alternate approach to the circles idea, I could use a line graph with varying symbology to show frequencies over time from multiple nations. This could be easier to visualize compared to the circle idea.

### Second Round Practice sketches

These sketches are a bit more high fidelity. I have decided to look at the number of nuclear test by the US compared to the number of war operations in vietnam during an overlapping time frame. I am trying to figure out a way to best group the data points and visualize them. This approach with boxes, colors, and cirles is one option.

I am starting to have a clearer understanding of how I want to visually separate the categories here. accumulate circles as data points with one category group upward and one growing downward. This could be a nice juxtaposition.

This sketch is a zoomed out view of the previous sketch, if I were to show that same sketch but each one represented a certain date range, it would look like the sketch below. I like the look of the small multiples.

### Third Round Practice sketches

Here is one of my final mock ups. I want to use this method but add hundreds of columns to each year of tests/operations. It will be a great visual as a bar graph from a distance but give a viewer the detail of a single name when viewed up close.
