## Process

### Clock 1
In this clock, I wanted to focus on different styles of bars moving around a screen to represent time in an abstract way. The second are shwon by a diagonal rectangle moving back and forth, switching directions at the edge of the screen every 60 seconds. The minutes have a short path, going back and forth in the bottom right corner as a thicker rectangle, which also has a number to show the minutes. The hours are in the top left and is shown by a rectangle (also moving back and forth slowly) and has dots on the bottom edge of the circle. The dots show the hour by filling up as many as the hour time is, and leaving the rest unfilled. Also, the hour square would be dark or light based on AM or PM
