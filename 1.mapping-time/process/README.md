## Process

### Clock 1
In this clock, I wanted to focus on different styles, shapes, and colors of bars moving around a screen to represent time in an abstract way. The seconds are shwon by a diagonal rectangle moving back and forth, switching directions at the edge of the screen every 60 seconds. The minutes have a short path, going back and forth in the bottom right corner as a thicker rectangle, which also has a number to show the minutes. The hours are in the top left and is shown by a rectangle (also moving back and forth slowly) and has dots on the bottom edge of the circle. The dots show the hour by filling up as many as the hour time is, and leaving the rest unfilled. Also, the hour square would be dark or light based on AM or PM

### Clock 2

I wanted to focus on randomness in this visualization and use color, shape and numerical data to represent the time. All of the circles move to random places around the screen at either every second, minute or hour. The minute and hour cirlce have a number to help represent time, while the seconds circle does not, because we usually don't have to know seconds. I think this will be a fun way to represnt time with random locations, because it is usually shown in such a structured way.

### Clock 3

This is a funky clock that is inspired by a pyschic's hand. Shape, color, value, and size are used to visualize this graphic. The hour represented by the filled dots along the six fingered hand. Minutes are shown by the triangle in the middle rotating every time the interor triangle grows out (by seconds) to fill in the space of the entire triangle. Then, the seconds triangle grows again.
