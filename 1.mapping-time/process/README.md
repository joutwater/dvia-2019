## Process

Hours minutes seconds...

### Clock 1

In this clock, I wanted to focus on different styles, shapes, and colors of bars moving around a screen to represent time in an abstract way. The seconds are shwon by a diagonal rectangle moving back and forth, switching directions at the edge of the screen every 60 seconds. The minutes have a short path, going back and forth in the bottom right corner as a thicker rectangle, which also has a number to show the minutes. The hours are in the top left and is shown by a rectangle (also moving back and forth slowly) and has dots on the bottom edge of the circle. The dots show the hour by filling up as many as the hour time is, and leaving the rest unfilled. Also, the hour square would be dark or light based on AM or PM

### Clock 2

I wanted to focus on randomness in this visualization and use color, shape and numerical data to represent the time. All of the circles move to random places around the screen at either every second, minute or hour. The minute and hour cirlce have a number to help represent time, while the seconds circle does not, because we usually don't have to know seconds. I think this will be a fun way to represnt time with random locations, because it is usually shown in such a structured way.

### Clock 3

This is a funky clock that is inspired by a pyschic's hand. Shape, color, value, and size are used to visualize this graphic. The hour represented by the filled dots along the six fingered hand. Minutes are shown by the triangle in the middle rotating every time the interor triangle grows out (by seconds) to fill in the space of the entire triangle. Then, the seconds triangle grows again.

Year month day moon...

### Clock 1A

This clock relates season to day of the month. I chose to use hue and value to visualize the seasons, with each season having its own color and each color's value changing from light, to dark, to light. The day of the month will use position (a circle moving from top to bottom, filling in each empy circle in sequence) to relate to the time of the season. I think it is interesting to compare the position to the color and value in the background. About three months worth of positioning would have to cycle before the color hue changes.

### Clock 2A

I am interested in relating my potential lifespan of 100 years to the month within each year. The century timespan would be represented by a circle changing in hue and position (blue to purple, left to right). The month of the year would be shown by texture and position, (sparse point to dense points, left to right).

### Clock 3A

I want to relate Day of the month and the moon cylce in my third clock. The day of the month is shown in s form similsr to an analog clock, applying the retinal variable of orientation and position. The moon cycle is shown by a pie graphic changing shape from no moon, to moon, back to no moon, across the screen. The variables used are shape and position.

Combined Clocks.....

### Combined Clock 1

This time represenation is an frankenstein of previous clocks but I think it will be a cool visualization if it works correctly. All retinal variables except value and texture are used. The challenging part will be to get the moon to cycle and change shape properly.

### Combined Clock 2

This is also a continuation of another previous idea that I ended up never creating
