### Combined Clocks process

In this combined clock, I wanted to combine the most intriguing aspects of previous time visualizations into a combined piece.
I enjoyed the effective synthesis of my vertical bars piece, but I wanted to juxtapose discrete value representation surrounded by continuous data representations.
As you can see, the seconds, minutes, and hours, ticking away is a nice balance to the smooth movements of the moon cycle and the seasonal background colors.
In terms of retinal variables, I was excited to use size, shape, hue, position, and orientation to represent time.
Size defines the scale between the hours/mins/secs clock, moon cycle, and seasons, each progressing to a large realization of time.
Shape helps distingusih between the hours/mins/secs clock and the moon cycle shape of a circle/pie.
Hue aids in representing the differences between all aspects of the time variables, and helps group the hours/mins/secs clock together through grayscale.
Position is helpful in deinfing the differences between each aspect of the hours/min/secs clock and is useful in showing the timing in the cycle of the moon.
Orientation is especially helpful to show how full the moon is and whether or not it is waning or waxing.

The most challenging aspect in this visualization was creating the code to move the moon around the shape of the hours/mins/secs clock square.
I had to divide each turning point into eights and calculate the X and Y coordinates to translate too
Also, getting the pie to change in order to reflect the moon fullness was a challenge.
Although the two represented the same variable in a way, I thought it was an important way to show how the moon is changing over time.
