### Mapping 1

This is display looks at the magnitude of earthquakes over time for various continents once they are clicked. The line graph shows events through the points and the different colors show whether the quake was under land or water. The water would be clickable and would display the details regarding that tsunami. I use the retinal variables of size, color, and shape
