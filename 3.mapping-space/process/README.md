## Process

### Mapping 1

This display looks at the magnitude of earthquakes over time for various continents, once they are clicked. The line graph shows events through the points and the different colors show whether the quake was under land or water. The water would be clickable and would display the details regarding that tsunami. I use the retinal variables of size, color, and shape

This is a radial graph that depicts the proximity of earthquakes to single, large volcanoes. If a quake is clicked, the radius will shrink or exapnd to show the relative magnitude, and a window will pop up describing the attributes of that quake. I use the retinal variables of size, color, shape, and texture (for the faultline)

The viz below shows an idea of looking at the a cross section along a fault line or sites of multiple quakes to look at the subterranean characteristics / horizontal distance compared to magnitude and depth. I use retinal variables of size, shape, color, value, and texture

### Mapping part 2

I was able to find my own earthquake dataset and have it display in leaflet at a certain framing and center point. I will trim my dataset to only include those closer to the san andreas fault, and then add the polyline of san andreas fault to the mapping

I also spent some time using google spreadsheets to do a quick analysis on earthquakes south to north. This is a bar graph showing depth

Following a similar exploration, I looked at the same but showing magnitude
